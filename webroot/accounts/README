This accounts app was built through trial and error after referencing the following resources:
Creating a custom user model: https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/22/how-to-extend-django-user-model.html#abstractuser
Creating a user signup view: https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2017/02/18/how-to-create-user-sign-up-view.html

This was also referenced, but I deleted most of the stuff here, because it was overly complicated.
Instead, I just used the idea of creating a separate accounts app for account-related matters
