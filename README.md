This is Group 13's CMPT 470 Term Project. It is a textbook buy/sell website for students looking to save money on textbooks. The motivation for this project came from the creators getting fed up trying to use textbook buy/sell Facebook pages, which are cluttered and difficult to navigate.

To start the project, simply have vagrant installed on your machine, and run the command, "vagrant up"
After this, navigate to http://localhost:8080/ and you should see the website up and running in development mode
