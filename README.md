# Textbook Buy/Sell Website
## About
This is Group 13's CMPT 470 Term Project. It is a textbook buy/sell website for students looking to save money on textbooks. The motivation for this project came from the creators getting fed up trying to use textbook buy/sell Facebook pages, which are cluttered and difficult to navigate.

## Setup/Usage
To start the project, have vagrant installed on your machine, and run the command, "vagrant up"
After this, navigate to [the login page](http://localhost:8080/accounts/login) and you should see the website up and running in development mode.

When you start the application, there are a few pre-created accounts: tclellan, agrawal, cwzhang, and gds3 (the members of our group). Each account has the same password: asdfasdf123

You can also create your own account by using the sign up page (linked to on the login page)

Password Reset Emails: In order for this feature to work, you must have entered a valid email address when creating your account. When you receive an email, it will probably end up in your spam folder, so be sure to check there.
